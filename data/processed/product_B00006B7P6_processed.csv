"I have used the whole line of Epson Premium papers and the Luster finish is my favorite. Using an Epson 1270 for years I was able to create high quality prints reliably and repeatedly. I recently upgraded to an Epson R1800, the print quality is now identical to conventional photo prints. Actually, since I hated darkroom dodging and burning sessions, my digital prints are vastly improved over their conventional counterparts due to the ease with witch proofs can be made. With the new R1800 prints come out instantly dry and beautiful.This is the paper that allows you to have a true home print lab.Price is the only drawback. (Sheets are cheaper than rolls.)"
"I've tried many kinds and brands of photo paper, but this Epson Premium Lustre is the best, even printed on a Canon i9900 printer!"
"Best paper I have ever used and I've used them all! Works great on an HP 7760 printer and gives a clean, crystalline-like finish. Very professional appearing images and black area won't stick to glass frames like some other papers do. Worth the extra cost as quality is the best."
"I do large format prints for friends , family, of my best stuff, and this paper is excellent. I like the fact that it isn't a high gloss paper; somewhere in between gloss and matte. I use an Epson printer so the prints are superb. I would expect as much on any decent printer."
"Having used just about every paper available from Epson for the Stylus1280 including the Velvet Fine Art,I'd have to say this one is the best.Just using the supplied profile (Premium Glossy Photo Paper - on the 1280) the results were very good.Any other paper, results were okay but bettered with custom profiles.This will now be my standard photo paper on the 1280 and future epson printers."
"Epson S041407 Premium Luster Photo Paper 13 X 19 (50-Sheet)This is a superb paper which presents excellent color density without loss of image detail, while avoiding the sometimes distracting reflections of glossy paper."
"Epson Ultra Premium Luster photo paper is beyond excellent... but please verify what size you are buying!! The ""Model Number"" and Manufacturers ""Part Number"" do not match. The photo in the listing shows a 50 sheet box of 13"" x 19"" inch paper... yet the manufactures part number is actually for a 50 sheet box of 11.7"" by 16.5"" paper. Just a word to the wise. I'm sure that the manufactures part number is just a typo... and sure that this really is the 13 x 19 paper."
"This paper in combination with an Omni Page monitor calibrator, PhotoShop, and an Epson R1800 produces the best (sharpest and most colorful) photographs I have ever seen. It is definately worth the price. I am rather rural, so I have to order ink and paper through Amazon, but I would have to order it in any case. Through Amazon, I always get both ink and paper in reasonable time."
"I have done digital photography for many years now.I have always had Epson printers, 1270 in the year 2000, R-2400 later, then 3880 in the past year, all of which have been just terrific!Have tried many papers, but for sales, reliability, consistency and just the finest found, Epson Premium Luster Photo paper and Semigloss have always played the major role in my purchases.They are just right- affordable, tried and true.BLB"
"I've been using the Epson Ultra Premium luster and glossy paper for quite some time on my Stylus R3000, and it's become my standard ""just works"" paper for when I want near maximum-quality photo paper with a standard finish that ""just works"" with my printer without messing with ICC profiles or advanced printer settings. I've only recently gotten around to printing anything this large on photo paper though.This larger sized paper seems to be no different in quality than the smaller cuts with the same product name. Because of this I'd recommend going though at least 50 sheets of 8.5x11 or even 4x6 of the same type to become familiar with what it looks like before dropping the cash for large sizes like this, but if you're already familiar with smaller Ultra Premium Luster then you know what you're going to get with this stuff.Other papers out there by companies like Red River are nicer in various ways, and less expensive per square inch, but at the very least they're going to require their own ICC profiles and possibly printer setting tweaking. If you need to just show up at some place where there's an Epson printer or othetrwise can't get full control of the printing process due to lack of time or whatever, the Epson Ultra Premium papers are always the thing to use when you need the best quality output possible without any special configuration or calibration."
"Just wish it wasn't so expensive. Simply the best paper for printing from your Epson Photo Stylus. Soft dull gloss finish is just enough to make your images pop without being too shiny or too flat. Heavy weight, similar to photo paper, I'd say. Not card stock, but not transparent text weight either. You'll love it. Buy it."
Probably the best paper I have ever used. Super heavyweight and with Epson pigment inks. it's very water resistant.
"I have always been a fan of matte paper, however, I have been experimenting with Epson Lustre and it is the best for definition and over all in every catagory. Tks Amazon."
This paper makes beautiful prints on my Epson R3880 printer and exceeds my expectations. The packaging is excellent as well. I highly recommend it to Epson printer owners.
This paper was a class requirement for my final photography course. I hated spending the money but once I used the paper and saw how excellent the quality was on my finished products I was completely satisfied.
This very large paper works extremely well with my printer (an Epson R3000). The colors are true and the luster finish prevents glare and bright reflections.
"GREAT FAST SERVICE, USED FOR SERVAL CLASSES FOR TWO SEMESTERS, I LOVED THE PHOTO'S FINISH PRODUCT, I WOULD LIKE IT CHEAPER."
I'm pretty pleased with this paper. Recently bought an Epson Stylus Photo R2880 and I can definitely show my work with pride on this paper. I've only used it for printing some of my highly saturated fine art photography works and it shows well.
I do not have a pro printer but I use Epson Stylus Photo 1400 which prints very professional quality prints.
This is my favorite photo paper for this price and I print a lot of my photography on it. All my photos look great when printed on this paper just make sure you print on a good printer with it and set up your color profiles in photoshop correctly and then you're ready to go!
The picture comes out great in this paper I advise you that you should buy this paper it's worth the price
"Epson paper is, well, epson paper. I got my order in a shorter period of time than expected and am completely satisfied."
The best product quality. Of all the photo papers I have used in the past. I strongly recommend Epson printers and media like this paper.
"I'm a student and Epson Premium Luster is highly recommended by the professor. I can see why. The blacks are deep and rich and it just looks fantastic. Epson makes some of the best paper available. If you want professional quality, this is the best choice."
This paper make great prints on my Epson 1800. If your going to bother printing yourself might as well use the best.
"ridiculously priced at just over $85 at Amazon and well over $110 from the manufacturer. Don't you just wonder what kind of margin Epson makes on this product, other papers, and their inks, which are also way overpriced. A nice premium luster printing surface to use as an alternative is made by InkPress and sold in a number of different sizes. This size of 13 x 19 can be purchased from a seller on eBay for considerably less."
What a disapointment. Epson used to ship Premium Photo Semi Gloss better than that. So much for all efforts saving trees.
The paper has always been wonderful. I have used it many times with my portrait pictures. The company is to be desired. They never said they DON'T deliver APO. I only learned of this by contacting THEM a month later. I order from another now.
It is a great product
"Received the Epson Ink in record time even with regular mail. Name brand Epson, not a refill. Thank you very much - I will order again."

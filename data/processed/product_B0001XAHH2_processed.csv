"I am very pleased with the quality of this product. I bought four different colors of the chair, and I love them all. The paint color is true to the picture. The chairs are sturdy and can easily support an adult if you are looking to sit with your child at the table for any period of time. I also thought it was fairly easy to assemble, and that is coming from a mom not a dad :) This product might seem pricier, but compared to similar chairs from Pottery Barn or Land of Nod, it is much more affordable, and just as cute."
"Product is fine however it was marketed as a replacement for a chair and desk combo, the chair does NOT fit the desk for which it was marketed, chair is too small."
I purchased this chair with the understanding that it was for ages 6-8...NOT TRUE. Returned it....This chair was just the right size for an American Girl doll.
"I ordered this chair for my 7 year old daughter (who is on the small size) for her desk. It states for ages 5-8. NO WAY!! I received the chair today and was in shock to see how small it was!! My 5 year old twins are even to big for it!! Although it seems to be a well made chair, it would ideally fit a child ages 1-4. They should change the age decription so people dont have to go through the problem of returning this item time and time again!"
"I was looking for a desk and decided on the Reflections Pearl White Student Desk by Thomasville via amazon.com. During the search Amazon recommended this chair to go along with the desk and offered a discount for buying the 2 together. This chair, however, is TOO SHORT to be used at a desk. The seat is 8 to 10 inches too low. When my granddaughter sits in the chair the desk comes to her neck. I would not have chosen the desk if Amazon had not recommended it to compliment the desk. I then had to go and buy another chair."
This chair is cute and the perfect size for kids. I had no problems assembling it. I am a photographer and i use this when photographing kids. It's sturdy and a great size for toddlers and kids.
"I bought two for my 5-year old daughter. Shipping is super fast. Chair is in great quality. Match her little table (24&#34;) perfectly. Both my daughter and I can comfortably sit in. I think it can last for pretty long time. But if you are buying it to match up a regular desk (adult size), it's way too small."
"I wanted a table and chair set for my granddaughter for Christmas, couldn't find a set like I wanted to for what I wanted to spend. I found these chairs, they shipped immediately and they are wonderful. Very heavy quality, they are not a cheap &#34;kids&#34; set. The are oversized, should last her for years.....and then they become an heirloom.....great company to order from, great chair."
we are still waiting for replacement parts broken leg leg snapped while my grandduatherwas sitting at her new desk ...........................
KidKraft is a wonderful company and makes solid furniture. I buy items from this company for my grandchildren all the time
"These are beautiful and worth every penny. Got on sale for 25.00! Well built and are beautiful with our Land of Nod Table. Perfect for my child, 3 years old. Mom and Dad sit in them; very well built."
We bought this chair to accompany a white desk for our 7 year old daughter. It's a little small and I don't anticipate getting much more than 2 years out of it - but for now it's perfect and she says that it's very comfortable. It was easy to put together and is sturdy.
Careful! The box for this chair indicates it's for ages 5-8.Nowhere on the website does it state this is a TINY chair!
I ordered the KidKraft Brighton Chairs and Table for my granddaughters for Christmas. Less than 6 months later the Pink Chair had to be repaired and now I'm hoping it will hold up after that repair. I researched a lot and found this product had high marks and I wanted a sturdy set for the Grandchildren. It is disappointing and embarrassing to give a gift which does not stand up even for 6 months. I would be hesitant to add 2 more chairs to this set as I had plannedBrighton Chair
The Brighton Chair was a great buy for my children. My daughters enjoy the time spent learning while sitting in it.
"This chair is very sturdy and well made, pretty easy to put together, but check out the measurements carefully. It is really tiny. I got it for my daughter's dressing table/desk because the opening is very narrow. I guess I didn't realize just how short the chair is. If you want a sturdy little chair for a child-sized table, this is the one, but it just doesn't work for a more regular sized desk or table."
This chair is so nice and cute for my daughter. We love it. It was very easy to put together and looks great. Very happy with this purchase!
"I bought this chair because it was recommends to go with a 4D Concepts Kids Desk sold by Amazon. I had to return it because it was WAY too small. My daughter is an average sized 7YO. When she sat at the desk in this chair, the desktop was at her upper chest/neck. This is a kiddie chair meant to be used with a toddler desk. Otherwise, it was fairly easy to put together, seemed fairly well made. Just be aware that it is very small."
"I wanted to buy four chairs to make up a set with a table I have. Why in the world would I be limited to buying only 3 chairs of the same color? I placed the order hoping to then purchase a single chair but the order was denied. There was nothing obvious on the order site indicating that there were limited quantities, so what's the deal?"
"I bought a couple of these chairs for my daughters room and it is a nice product. I was worried about the quality, but I am very happy. As a big guy having tea parties with my girl, I needed to be sure NOT to land on the ground. Would buy again if I had the need."
"we received these 3 days ago from another chain store for my 26 month old daughter. The Kidkraft Brighton chair is adorable and very sturdy! we ordered one in sage and one in pink and paired them with pottery barn kid's carolina small table. that particular table had the dimensions i wanted but could not find elsewhere, however i did not like pottery barn kids colors/styles/price options when it came to chairs. i am extremely happy with this chair. the quality matches pottery barn and the style is much better for the price. my 2 year old has quickly learned to properly balance herself in a chair and i am guessing that there will rarely be backwards tumbles because this chair has great ""footing"" and is very steady. the particular combo - the kidkraft brighton chair with the pottery barn kids carolina table will last my daughter for many years - she has to climb a bit to get into this chair but is very happy doing so and has no problem getting up or down by herself. this chair height is almost exactly the height of the PBK carolina chairs, so it pairs perfectly with the table. the sage and green are very fresh, ""ice cream shop-y"" colors and my daughter is totally happy. we did not order the kidcraft brighton table/desk because it would be too high for a 2 year old and not good dimensions for crafting. such a cute chair!"
"what a beautiful chair! nicely detailed. no visible fasteners. very sturdy. they look lovely in my little girls room, she loves them too. I highly recommend this chair."
We bought this chair for Xmas for my 6 yr old. It is just the right height for her child-size desk. For use with a standard sized desk it would be too small. It is perfect.
We've had it almost two years. It's still going strong. Little girl (6 now) loves the pink. Mom & Dad love the durability.
"I recently ordered the white table and four chairs for my daughters for Christmas. It is an adorable set, - BUT - I was VERY DISAPPOINTED when I received the order. I found that the table was cracked and the drawer glides were installed incorrectly, so the drawer can not even be used! Plus, they neglected to send one of the chairs!!I sent an email to the company to explain the problem. They finally sent the chair 2 weeks later, but I still have not gotten a response on the broken table after nearly one month! To make matters worse, the chair they sent had a rotten leg. So it broke the very first time my fifty pound daughter sat on it!!I have once again emailed the company. I hope I get a response this time!! I am tired of making up stories for why Santa and his elves have not taken care of this problem!!!"

"This sure is HOT! LOL...which is a good quality in a HOT glue gun! I used this for VBS crafts and did have to be extremely careful about not letting the kids touch the glue until it was dry. However...it's a HOT glue gun...I expected it to be hot! It worked just fine. Very little glue drip. Might be a little more handy if it had a low/high temp setting but it gets the job done. The trigger seemed a tad flimsy for an ""Professional"" glue gun but it did work well and there was no hand/finger strain. Time will tell on how it holds up. I gave it to my husband when I finished with VBS (and took my old one back that he ""borrowed"") for him to use in his hobby room as he needs the higher temps more than I do and my old one has two temp settings. All in all...we are both happy :)"
"Just got this gun. It seems to work as advertised. But the length of the barrel from the tip to where a stick of glue disappears into the barrel at the back is 6 3/4"". To move the glue through the barrel you need to put another stick in to push the last stick through. If you're on your last stick you won't be able to use the remaining glue in the barrel until you get another stick. Maybe other guns work the same way but this gun is a bit longer than some of the others. I will keep the gun but if I want to change glue type because I'm moving from one application to another, it means I'll have to waste some glue to do it. Not a big deal but it might be a consideration for some."
"This glue gun heats quickly (about 4-5 mins) and the glue comes out evenly with little dripping. I like the large handle to give me more leverage, and I like the flip-up stand on the front to keep it upright. I bought theArrow Fastener AP10-4 10-Inch All Purpose Glue Sticksto go with the glue gun and they work great."
"I have used lots of glue guns before and not thought too much about them. However, my wife had trouble with the trigger and getting a smooth flow. The full hand trigger is so smart for someone with hand strength problems. This is the only multi finger glue gun that I have seen. I highly recommend it. Full heat and easy operation. Kudos"
"I don't use hot glue guns much and I bought this one just to repair decoys that people have shot, but so far it works fine. Plug it in, let it get hot, and the glue comes out nice and easy and it doesn't drip. Couldn't ask for much more."
"Use in my shop for all kinds of project, don't know how I did with out it. Gun get pretty hot, in short period time great for those quick fixes."
"I have owned about 10 glue guns in the past year and this one blows them all away. Finally, a glue gun where you can control how much or how little glue you want to come out and has minimal dripping.If you need a glue gun I totally recommend this one."
Have used this glue gun at least a dozen times and so far its been good. Haven't had any issues with the glue dripping excessively like have with other glues guns I have purchased in the past.
"I use this to heat up glue to put inserts into my archery arrows.It works very well, getting the glue really hot so it doesn't begin to dry before I've pushed in the inserts.You need the glue very hot for this because if it isn't down right liquified it dries too much before it sets and you don't get a good hold."
"I do not use this routinely, as in crafts. I use it only as a &#34;tool&#34; to glue stuff together, fill holes, fix loose joints, etc.For that, it has done well, and importantly, it is not a &#34;dripper&#34;."
"I am past the return date apparently though it has only been three weeks and I have only used three times. I can not get the gun to heat. Worked fine the first time, refused to heat the second time and tried to heat up the third time but you had to manually push the stick forward instead of using the trigger. Sorry but it is a piece of junk."
"This is only the second time I have used a glue gun. I have to tell you that I am a paper crafted and prefer to use tape as my adhesive, due to my lack of comfort with glue. However, this glue gun is so easy to use and such high quality that I plan to use it more often! Highly recommend."
This glue gun is very well made. I would recommed it.Buy it. It is better than the stanley glue guns.
Beats the heck out of the smaller ones when you've got a big job to get done. I don't even bother to pull out the little smaller glue gun any more.
"Heats up fairly fast, doesn't drip, the sliding trigger is very comfy. The only thing I would add is a little rubber gasket to hold the next glue stick in line when the first one is running out but it's really not a big issue if you use the long sticks."
"We have been using an old Black & Decker glue gun for 20 years, which still works well, but tried this Surebonder HE-750 model due to the high reviews.I am very disappointed. After giving the glue gun about 10 minutes to heat up, glue doesn't consistently come out when the trigger is pulled. Many times I can pull the trigger back fully multiple times and nothing comes out. This seems to be because the trigger applies force to the glue stick through a weak spring, instead of a direct linkage on the old Black & Decker. You kinda need to hold in the trigger all the way until the glue stick starts moving due to the spring. When the trigger is released, the glue stick moves back up in the tube.Because of the spring, I don't have near the amount of control that I had with the Black & Decker.Also, it seems that 2 four-inch tubes must be fed in (or one 8-inch tube) to get any glue to be dispensed. With a single 4-inch tube installed, I didn't get any glue to come out at all.On the plus side, the handle doesn't seem to get quite as hot."
"This glue gun is better than anything in this price range and better than most costing 3 or 4 times more. Heats up quickly, drips very little and takes much less effort to feed than most glue guns. As another reviewer mentioned, you can start feeding a new stick in before you run totally out meaning you can just keep going with the same level of effort. I hope they never stop making this gun because for some reason no one else can seem to get it right. I used theseSteinel 04043 GF 260 High Strength 12"" Glue Sticks, 15 Sticksglue sticks in a big stair railing project and have been so impressed with both."
"I have never needed a two-heat setting, and this glue gun does everything need it to. Does not drip, feeds glue sticks (we bought cheap &#34;Multi Temp Glue Sticks-50PK/7/16 Inch x4 Inch&#34; with it) evenly and is no fuss. Works great!"
"I've been able to use it for one project so far (a decent-sized one, though) and I loved it. Great gun. Heats perfectly (you have no idea how many burns I got...) without even getting hot in the handle. Didn't drip pretty much at all that I can recall when I set it up on its stand, although I'm not sure if maybe that's just from the quality of sticks I used. (Speaking of which, checktheseout.)"
Keep in mind this is larger than your normal budget glue gun but is of much better quality and the even pull of the &#34;trigger&#34; should be the new standard.
"Unlike other guns I've seen, this one have a 4 finger trigger. You can use your entire hand wich is much better than using just 2 fingers. And the trigger moves back and forward in a straight motion instead of up and down in an arc. With a 4 finger trigger in 45 degrees position (Surebonder Pro 4000), you make the most force with your last 2 fingers wich are the weakest. It's like using a staple gun. A straight trigger, like the one on this gun, is better designed and easier to use.This gun doesn't drip, it's not too hot (80W) and it's very lightweight. I had an Arrow TR 400 gun with a 2 finger trigger and was disappointed with it. Had to pull very hard to push the glue stick through and I ended up removing the trigger and pushing the stick by hand.I hope they don't discontinue this item. It's the best glue gun you can buy for $20 bucks and even better than more expensive guns."
"And what can be more important than that?! The Wife uses a glue gun in her flower arranging hobby. We have purchased several in the past, to include the Stanley and a couple other ""high rated"" guns. She prefers this one for several important reasons. First is the stand. It works. For those who regularly use a glue gun, you know how rare this is. The wire stand on the Surebonder is wide enough and strong enough that the gun doesn't fall over. Couple this gun with the Surebonder glue gun stand and you are home free! There is some dripping, but compared to other ""dripless"" guns, it is almost negligible. It heats quickly and thanks to the design of the trigger, it is less fatiguing to use. This gun gets an easy 5 stars and without going to the $80-$100 professional models, you are not going to get a better gun!"
"Bought this in 2008. It lasted 3.5 years. I run a business and personally used the glue gun to seal over 2,200 packages. The handle just snapped for some reason. Maybe it's fixable but what's the point. It had a great life and can be replaced for 19.99 (at least as of today). No brainer. If you need a glue gun you can't go wrong. Hopefully my next will last as long as my first. I buy these glue sticks if you are interested, they are 10"" (long) by .44 inches. 94 count. So only buy if you need that many. Was 21.00 the last couple times, but now are 30.00. Still a pretty good deal since Amazon sells it with no shipping charge for prime,Surebonder 725R510 10-Inch All Temperature Glue Sticks"
"I am not employed in any way by surebonder or amazon. I am not being paid or compensated in any way. The gun is a winner. It has glue coming out (slowly at first) within about 40 seconds. I have owned, used, and burned up or smashed about ten glue guns over the years. This is the second best one I have bought. The best one is an industrial quality one that cost me a real chunk of money. If you are looking at cheap 80w glue guns for ten dollars or so, forget it. I bought one one and it is really only about 20w and barely melts the glue. I also bought one that is supposedly 250w and it melts exactly like a cheap 40w with a bad temperature sensor (china junk). Be smart, buy this one and be happy about getting a good tool for cheap. I have owned Arrow, Bostitch, Stanley,Sears, Walmart, and a couple other brands of glue guns. I like this one, it is a good deal, it is made in TAIWAN."
"This is the best glue gun I have owned. Heats quickly and holds nearly 10 inches of glue sticks. The big advantage is that this model holds a fresh stick securely as soon as it is inserted. Some cheaper guns will not accept and feed a new glue stick until the old one is nearly out. With this model, as soon as you see the glue stick is getting low, you can add another and it will feed immediately. One other nice feature is that this model does not drip and bubble glue out the tip when not in use-- glue stays hot, but waits for the trigger."
"It was amazing how fast I received this glue gun!! It was supposed to be here...tomorrow...7/10 but it got here on 7/7!! Which was great!!I used it right away...as I was in great need of the glue gun! It worked perfectly...a little smoke did come out...but otherwise perfectly! It puts out a nice thin strip of glue...so far does not drip and does not make much of a stringy mess! I have had an Aleen's Ultimate Glue Gun for many years and was ""never"" satisfied with it...it was a very very messy glue gun. The glue flow adjustment never ever worked! The nozzles would never stay on the gun...the glue would pour out of the back of the nozzles and then the nozzles would eventually fall off right in the middle of what ever I happened to be working on....it made using it a real problem. The nozzles would not stay on the gun no matter how tight I would get them on before plugging the gun in!This gun is so different, it is actually a pleasure to use! Should something happen in the near future that changes my mind I will write in an up-date!! So far this is a great gun...it is a little on the large size, but it is easy to use. I did buy the extra stand to go with it because I have not had any luck with the wire types that come with the gun...they tend to fall over...so I got this extra stand and it works great. The gun does not fall over and it even had a silicone pad to catch any drips that the glue will not stick to!! It was well worth the extra $6.!!!"
Works very well. EZ to control on how much glue is needed. The glue gun is light. This is a handy tool.
"I was a little skeptical about this glue gun. The trigger ""looked"" like the weak link, but after reading reviews on this item I have to admit, I'm really glad I bought this item. My old glue gun (old Sears Craftsman) leaked all the time, as a matter of fact, that's how I could tell that it was hot enough to work with. Not so with this gun! NO leaks! Very happy with my purchase and would recommend this glue gun to all my friends. Just sayin'."
Works great and I received it in a timely manner. We have already used about three glue sticks that were very old and it glued just fine. Please be careful with this or any other glue gun because it will burn flesh as stated by the manufacturer. Next time I use it I will have on leather gloves.
"So many glue guns on the market have so many bad reviews that I spent quite a long time deciding which gun to buy. Many glue guns suffer from leaking nozzles, flimsy construction (breaking triggers especially), stands which don't work etc. This one had the best reviews overall, so I bought it even though there are less expensive models.Well, I'm glad I did. I have nothing but good to say about this gun. First of all, it doesn't leak. Not a bit. Secondly, the trigger is easy and smooth, thanks to its sliding design (as opposed to pivoting). It heats up fast and stays hot, even when dispensing glue at a high rate. The stand actually works, and the gun is plenty stable when using it. Finally, it seems plenty sturdy to do what it needs to do for many, many sticks of glue.Dunno what else there is to say about a glue gun, but if the mixed reviews of almost every other glue gun in a similar price range have you wary, be confident that this one will meet expectations."
For the price you can't go wrong. Works great with very little dripping. Love the trigger on this. Would highly reccamend this glue gun!
"I haven't heard any complaints from the wife since I got this for her... This glue gun has been great so far!===================================================================***Follow up Review***----------------------My wife has used this product to create many, many, many hairbows. I'd have to say that if I were a little girl, that I'd be in heaven with how many bows she's created! My daughters have picked out so many colors of ribbon that I'm not sure how we will be able to afford all of it, but the wife is happy to do it for the girls. It is amazing to see how much joy just a little bit of ribbon and glue can do for a child! This glue gun has been a miracle product for me because I've seen the prices some people sell these bows, like my wife's bows, at. I guess we will turn out even after all of this is said and done... It was either buy this and ribbon, or spend alot of money on bows that my children get interested in."
A gift for my &#34;crafter&#34; wife and she loves it. It replaces a small and difficult to use glue gun that gave her hand cramps after ten minutes of use. The Surebonder is large and easy to hold and use. Mamma is happy.
Works great - I wrapped all of my Chrstmas gifts with it this year - makes wrapping fast and I don't have to worry about things coming un-taped - Used brown butcher paper with beautiful ribbons - nice touch - New glue gun works GREAT!
"This is my first glue gun as I have recently gotten more into crafting. I painted some seashells and a frame and used this to glue the shells onto it. I was a little concerned at first about dripping hot glue (not an issue), burning myself (not an issue), and how well the glue would stick (not an issue). Great purchase, my new favorite toy! :)"
"This is a perfect low end glue gun. works perfect and had a very reasonable price tag on it, highly recommend."
Bought this along with the &#34;Stanley&#34; GS20DT Dual Temp. 4&#34; glue sticks (24 pack. They work we3ll together. Nice addition to my shop.
"Good Value...Product as advertised. Have not use the HE 750 High Temp Heater Glue yet. However, I am confident this product will help with the project I am planning on doing. Would buy from this seller again.."
"I wish I had researched the size of this thing more before I bought it. If you'r interested in a hot glue gun for projects like making JEWELRY, CARDS, MASKS, and other general crafting then do NOT get this! It's just way too long (distance between your hand and where the glue comes out) and heavy to do any of these things! I can't tell you how well it works because I didn't even take it out of the packaging. I will post pictures up for a size comparison."
I opened the box and couldn't believe it. I had to look twice. This glue gun doesn't come with any glue!Update: Works fine. As cheap as the glue is I don't know why it didn't come with some. I doesn't seem very sturdy.
